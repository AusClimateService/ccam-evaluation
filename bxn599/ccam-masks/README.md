### Somewhat deprecated, new procedure will be to use Damien's scripts [here](https://github.com/AusClimateService/model-evaluation/blob/master/report_EOFY22/spatial_selection.py)

Script to create land/sea, NRM clusters, and AR6 masks

Requires [regionmask](https://regionmask.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) which can be found in conda/analysis3 on Gadi

NRM clusters taken from [Climate Change in Australia](https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/overview/methodology/nrm-regions/)

create_masks.py is an example script to make all the required masks in a single file.
