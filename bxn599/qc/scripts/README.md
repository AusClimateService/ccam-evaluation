Modify datadir and outdir in job_launcher.sh
./job_launcher.sh

After scripts have run:
module load conda/analysis3
python write_html.py /g/data/xv83/users/bxn599/ACS/qc/ccam_noresm2-mm_historical_aus-10i_12km

Workflow:

Step 1:
Use either job_launcher.sh or job_launcher_variables.sh to launch pbs jobs. 
Use job_launcher.sh to launch jobs for all the variables in one or more output streams.
Use job_launcher_variables.sh for a given set of variables in a single output stream.

Each pbs job runs one of the qc_job*.sh script.

The qc_job*.sh script calls qc_util.py to scan the DRS filesystem, and look at each
netcdf files. 

qc_util.py does,
- write out field statistics to a log files *.log (see --logfile argument)
- prduce timeseries plots of these field statistics to *.png (see --figdir argument)
- perform sanity check on the field statistics and write a log file (see --sanityfile argument)
All these files should be created under the same directory. 

Step 2: Use write_html.py
Create a html page linking to all the files generated by qc_util.py.

Step 3:
Push all the files created by qc_util.py and the index.html produced by write_html.py to 
a web server, e.g., accessdev:$HOME/public_html/
