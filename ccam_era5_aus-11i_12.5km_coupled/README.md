Note: Calculating monthly RAV for climpact variables may not be possible due to how RAV is calculated. RAV is divided by the standard deviation of obs, "Ïƒobs is the standard deviation of the inter-annual time
series of observations corresponding to the variable and season in question." and it isn't possible to get the monthly standard deviation on monthly data. Seasonal and annual RAV may be possible.
